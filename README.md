# SolarGuard-Intelligent-Defect-Detection-on-Solar-Panels-using-DeepLearning
This project uses deep learning to classify images of solar panels into six categories: Clean, Dusty, Bird-Drop, Electrical-Damage, Physical-Damage, and Snow-Covered. A ResNet-18 model is used for image classification. Based on the predicted class, the system suggests an appropriate solution to support maintenance decisions.
